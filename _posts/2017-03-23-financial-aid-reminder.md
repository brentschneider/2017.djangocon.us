title: "Financial Aid Reminder"
---

As part of our commitment to diversity, we are thrilled to announce that we will be supporting individuals who need financial assistance to attend DjangoCon US.

DEFNA ([Django Events Foundation North America](http://www.defna.org/)), the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/), and the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) have donated to help meet the cost of tickets, travel, and accommodation for attendees who need financial support. If you will not be able to attend DjangoCon US without financial help, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid.

In addition, this year, speakers and tutorial leaders will be provided with free conference tickets to speakers to encourage wider participation from the Django community.

You can apply for financial aid by filling out [the application](https://goo.gl/h8PTpC). You’ll need to provide your name, the amount you’re requesting, and some information about why you’re requesting funding. Applications need to be submitted by April 10th in order to be considered.

The DjangoCon US 2017 planning committee will review financial aid applications and notify those who have been accepted by May 24, 2017. Because our budget is limited, preference will be given to potential speakers and tutorial leaders, especially first-time speakers, and members of underrepresented groups.

## Diversity Sponsorships

Your organization can help increase diversity at DjangoCon US by contributing to the Financial Aid fund. Please contact our <a href="mailto:{{site.sponsors_email}}">Sponsorship Chair</a> for more information.

Alternatively when purchasing your ticket, you can either purchase an extra ticket for an attendee who couldn’t otherwise afford it, or you can add a dollar amount of your choosing.
