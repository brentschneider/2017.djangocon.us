There is **less than a week** left to [submit a talk or tutorial proposal to DjangoCon US 2017](/speaking/)!

We want to hear about your experience with and around Django. Remember, we encourage you to submit talks that might be:

 * about a topic other than Django
 * for Django users of all levels, including beginners
 * still being developed, or in progress
 * non-technical in nature

The conference isn't until August, so if you have a kernel of an idea, please submit it!

You've never spoken before? Not a problem! Our [speaker mentors](/speaking/speaker-resources/#need-some-help-with-your-talk) are here to help you. Is cost a concern? Not a problem! We have [financial aid](/financial-aid/) (deadline is also April 10th).

There is no reason not to apply! Here are two articles to get you started:

 * [Writing a PyCon Proposal by Brian Curtin](http://blog.briancurtin.com/posts/writing-a-pycon-proposal.html)
 * [How to Submit a Kickass Talk to otsconf (or any other conf for that matter) by the OpenTechSchool Conference](http://blog.otsconf.com/post/118360171200/how-to-submit-a-kickass-talk-to-otsconf-or-any)

As always, feel free to contact us if you have questions.

Don't wait and submit your proposals soon! We hope to see you at DjangoCon US in Spokane. :evergreen_tree:
