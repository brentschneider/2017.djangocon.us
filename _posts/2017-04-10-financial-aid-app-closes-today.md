Financial aid applications close on April 10th!

This is your friendly reminder that our [financial aid application](https://2017.djangocon.us/financial-aid/) closes on April 10th. We'll let you know in early May if your application for aid has been accepted. Be sure to get your application in ASAP!

We’ve had some questions from people who don’t feel like they are the type of person we’re looking for, but they still need financial help to attend DjangoCon US. Let us reassure you: we’re not looking to give any particular person funding! If you’re a member of an underrepresented group (whatever that means to you), if you have a lower income, or if your circumstances at this moment mean you need help to come to DjangoCon US, we want you to apply. You can ask for all or part of your costs to cover transportation, registration, or lodging. If you’re not sure whether or not you should apply for financial aid…the answer is, yes, if you need aid, you should apply!
