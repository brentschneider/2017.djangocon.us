title: "Announcing Our Call for Reviewers"
---

Do you love the Django community and want a great way to help out with DjangoCon US this year?

The DjangoCon US organizers are looking for volunteers to review talk and tutorial submissions. This will require a few hours of your time from now until April 24. Reviewing talks only takes a couple of minutes per talk. You don't need to review all talks and tutorials, and you don't need to review them all in one day. Most people find that reviewing talks for 30 minutes at a time, once or twice a week, gets them through the talks pretty quickly.

If youâ€™re interested in joining the review committee, please [drop us a line](mailto:hello@djangocon.us). We appreciate your help!
