## What Is DjangoCon US?

This August, more than 500 people from the Django community will descend upon Spokane for six days of tutorials, talks, and code sprints. There is no better place to recruit Django developers than at DjangoCon US!

Sponsoring DjangoCon US can help you:

- Recruit amazing Django developers
- Promote your product (hosting, Saas, developer tools) to hundreds of potential new customers
- Give back to the Django community and ensure its future happiness, health, and productivity

Because the conference is organized by [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, your sponsorship is tax-deductible!

## Sponsorship Levels

### Diversity Sponsorships

Django and the Python community at large pride themselves on their commitment to diversity and inclusion. Talk to us about contributing to our Financial Aid fund, which prioritizes grants for people from underrepresented groups. Diversity sponsorship funds will also be used to offset the cost of offering child care!

### Other Sponsorship Opportunities

The following a la carte offerings are available to increase visibility on site.
