                <p>The biggest obvious benefit to employees is being exposed to the conference material. The larger, but less obvious, benefit is the community interactions and connections your employees will make. Have a problem with a library? It's possible your employee knows one of the core maintainers or someone else who uses it and can reach out for some quick advice that simply isn't possible without the human connection. </p>
